With a much improved friction model, this controller (which does not succeed over very long times) more accurately represents the expected/human-like behaviour, making large excursions in pitch, and smaller ones in yaw.

Tweaks to the fitness function in an attempt to remove the long-term stability problem of 20110408-60e7b0d.

Very good general controller, and some *very* limited attention paid to target_yaw_velocity.

Its major problem is its long-term stability. The wheel_velocity gradually creeps up and up, until the corrections it attempts to make in yaw overwhelm it and topple the unicycle.
